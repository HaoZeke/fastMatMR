Description: "fastMatMR is an R package offering high-performance read and write operations for Matrix Market files. It acts as a thin wrapper around the 'fast_matrix_market' C++ library, offering speed and extended support for Matrix Market formats. Unlike other R packages, fastMatMR supports not just sparse matrices but also dense vectors and matrices. This makes it a versatile choice for dealing with .mtx files in R."
