## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed the package name from the title and removed quotes from the title and description.
* Used single quotes for software and package names in the description.
* Fixed the invalid URIs found in the documentation.
* Adjusted the usage of `\dontrun{}` in the package documentation.
* Added the [ROpensci review](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/606) to the DESCRIPTION
