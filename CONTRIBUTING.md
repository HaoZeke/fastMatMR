## Development

Your contributions make this project better for everyone. Thank you for
participating!

### Local Development

Often it is useful to have [pixi](https://prefix.dev/) handle the dependencies:

```bash
pixi shell
```

A `pre-commit` job is set up on CI to enforce consistent styles. It is advisable
to set it up locally as well using [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) for
isolation:

```bash
# Run before committing
pipx run pre-commit run --all-files
# Or install the git hook to enforce this
pipx run pre-commit install
```

For working with packages with compiled extensions, instead of `devtools::load_all()` it can be more useful to run this instead:

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::clean_dll()
cpp11::cpp_register()
devtools::document()
devtools::load_all()
```

Also don't forget to recreate the `readme` file:
```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::build_readme()
```

If you find that `pre-commit` for R is flaky, you can consider the following commands:

```bash
find . \( -path "./.pixi" -o -path "./renv" \) -prune -o -type f -name "*.R" -exec Rscript -e 'library(styler); style_file("{}")' \;
Rscript -e 'library(lintr); lintr::lint_package(".")'
```

#### Tests

Tests and checks are run on the CI, however locally one can use:

```bash
Rscript -e 'devtools::test()'
```


#### Documentation

Ideally each change should be documented. Major changes should be `vignettes`,
and minor ones can be added to `newsfragments`.

Benchmark vignettes are pre-computed via:

```bash
Rscript tools/rebuild-benchmarks.R
```

Which makes it faster to build the package and run checks.
