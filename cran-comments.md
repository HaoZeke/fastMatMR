## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Rewritten the DESCRIPTION to not include the package name.

* Fixed invalid URLs

As an aside, there is an ROpenSci review here: https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/606

The file URI's are not invalid, they render correctly on the [documentation
site](https://docs.ropensci.org/fastMatMR/) and the corresponding files are part
of the submission.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
