** About
~R~ bindings [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cpp11/index.html][using cpp11]] for reading and writing to [[https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/formats.html][Matrix Market files]] using
the excellent [[https://github.com/alugowski/fast_matrix_market][fast_matrix_market]] ~C++~ library.
** Usage
** Development
*** Local development
A ~pre-commit~ job is setup on CI to enforce consistent styles, so it is best to
set it up locally as well (using [[https://pypa.github.io/pipx][pipx]] for isolation):

#+begin_src sh
# Run before commiting
pipx run pre-commit run --all-files
# Or install the git hook to enforce this
pipx run pre-commit install
#+end_src
